# AtliQ-Hospitality-Analysis
## Overview
Dive into a dynamic world where data meets hospitality. This project harnesses the power of Power BI to deliver deep, actionable insights through comprehensive data analysis and visually stunning dashboards. From the initial stages of data extraction to the final, polished dashboards, we cover every aspect of the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to help stakeholders make informed and strategic decisions.

## Project Structure
1. DATA IMPORT: First I Gathered data from UNIFIED mENTORS and imported it into Power BI for data transformation.
2. DATA TRANSFORMATION: Used Power Query to clean the data, removed nulls and duplicates, and fine-tuned data types.
3. DATA LOADING AND MODELLING: Imported the transformed data into Power View for analysis. After completing the necessary cleaning, and transformation, I create the necessary relationships between the tables. (I created a calendar table separately for my convenience and connected the two tables based on a column key).
4. DATA IMPLEMENTATION: I used different DAX functions to create calculated measures and columns, refining the data for deeper insights.
5. REPORTS CREATION: First I designed a theme for my report from canva and then imported it to Power BI. After that, I Crafted a user-friendly report/dashboard that helps the organization make important decisions.
